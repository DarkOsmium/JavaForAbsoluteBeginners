public static void main(String[] arg){}          This is the main method of your code, can be created by typing main in
                                                 your class.
System.out.print                                 This prints whatever valid input is in the parentheses.
System.out.println                               This is the same as System.out.print except it prints a new line
System.out.format                                Works the same as System.out.print except you can format it. 2 arguments
                                                 one something and another something
%d                                               Is used with System.out.format. it can be inserted in the text and has a value
                                                 like a variable.Format specifier.Used for integers
%s                                               Same as %d but for strings
%._f                                             Same as %d but for doubles and floats. You can use ._ to tell it how many
                                                 decimal points.
\n                                               Creates new line when put in quotations in the parenthesis of the print
                                                 statements.
\b,\t                                            Like before but b puts backspace and t puts a tab.
\                                                This can make a command into text withing quotation marks.

int                                              This is used to store a value in a variable, only integers to a certain

                                                 symbol has a number equivalent.Also has a hexadecimal equivalent that starts
                                                 with \u.
String                                           Text between double quotes. More advanced char. Reference data type. Use
                                                 + sign to connect two strings. Careful for spacing.
+ - * /                                          These are the addition/subtraction/multiplication/division
(double,int,etc.)                                This will cast a variable to the wanted type of number or value.
import ____.____.____;                           This is for importing a package so you can use a class within it.
new Scanner(____);                               This scanner scans something. That something goes in the parentheses.
System.in                                        This can be put in a scanner telling it to scan the users input using the
                                                 keyboard,it is called standard input.
Scanner.next                                     This finds and returns the next complete token from the scanner
Scanner_____                                     This is how to store a scanner using a variable.
Scanner.next                                     Used to pause and wait for user input before continuing code
Scanner.nextInt                                  This returns a int instead of a string.
Scanner.nextDouble                               Like .nextInt but for double
Scanner.nextBoolean                              Like .nextInt but for Boolean
Scanner.nextLine                                 This reads entire line instead of last token
Scanner.next_______                              There are a few more like .nextInt

_____.equals(_____)                              Used to see if strings are the same. The equal method
switch                                           like the if statement but based on cases.
case_                                            A case will print what is under it if selected
break;                                           Stops the code from flowing on to code it shouldn't print.
default                                          Used in switch as the default thing that is printed.
ThreadLocalRandom.current().next__(_,_);         This is used to generate a random number between two numbers.

continue                                         Only skips current iteration.
do{}while()                                      Like while but it runs body before checking condition so it always runs at

__();                                            This makes the program run the method(function)
